I believe my solution works well because there is very minimal information being exchanged between the applications at initialization. There is only the need for two variables being exchanged. The update of the counter variable is also very easy to perform and will not use up a lot of resources from application 2. Application 1 will also only have to monitor the state of one variable and compare it to the total number of steps previously discovered in the initialization step.
